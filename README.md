# To-Do List Application

Welcome to the To-Do List Application project! This Python-based application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. This README will guide you through the features, setup instructions, and usage of the application.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks with descriptions and due dates.
- **View Tasks**: See a list of all tasks with their statuses.
- **Update Tasks**: Modify existing tasks, including changing their descriptions and due dates.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Status**: Mark tasks as completed or pending.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You will also need the following Python libraries:

- `json` (for data storage)
- `datetime` (for managing due dates)

These libraries are included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd todo-list-python
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies** (if any):

   This project does not require any additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python todo.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**: The application will prompt you to add, view, update, or delete tasks.

   - **Add a Task**: Enter the task description and due date.
   - **View Tasks**: Display all tasks with their current statuses.
   - **Update a Task**: Modify task details.
   - **Delete a Task**: Remove a task from the list.

## Example

Here is an example of how the application might be used:

```plaintext
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Exit

Choose an option: 1
